description: 'Learn how to integrate the Backrun Python SDK into your django application'
---

<Tip>
  You need a [Backrun.io](https://app.backrun.io/auth/signup) account and project for your
  application to go live.
</Tip>


## Install
Install the Backrun Python SDK using pip:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade backrun-sdk
```

## Configure

Initialize the SDK in your project's settings file

```python settings.py
import backrun_sdk

backrun_sdk.init(
    # add the public key for the project
    api_key="<project_api_key>",
    always_eager=True,
)
```


Add the django runner to your urls

```python urls.py
from backrun_sdk.django import serve

urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path("api/backrun/", serve),
]
```


## Add tasks

Add the @task decorator to any function in your project to make it a background task. Typical django convention is to create a tasks.py file

```python <your_app>/tasks.py
from backrun_sdk import task

@task()
def ping():
    return "PONG"
```

## Call them from anywhere
```python <your_app>/views.py
def request_handler(request, *args, **kwargs):
    ...
    ping.delay()
    ...
```
